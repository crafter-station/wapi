# wapi API notes

The SDK handles most of what follows — this is here so you know *why* it is shaped that way, and
what to watch for if you call the API directly.

Behaviours that are not guessable from the endpoint names. Each of these has cost someone real
debugging time; several are inherited from the interface wapi clones and are deliberate rather
than accidental.

## There are five success envelopes, not one

Do not write a single `unwrap(res.data)` helper and assume it applies everywhere.

| Shape | Endpoints |
| --- | --- |
| `{success, data}` | most routes |
| `{status}` — **no `success` key at all** | `GET /api/status` |
| `{success, api_key}` — at the top level | `POST .../regenerate-key` |
| `{success, publicUrl}` — at the top level | `POST /api/upload`, `POST /api/decrypt-media` |
| `{success, message}` | `POST .../restart` |
| no body at all (`204`) | `DELETE /api/whatsapp-sessions/{id}` |

## There are two failure envelopes, and which one you get tells you where it failed

- `{success: false, error: "…"}` — a route handler decided this. Session not connected, group
  not found, upload too large.
- `{success: false, message: "…", errors?: {field: [messages]}}` — middleware decided it.
  Authentication, validation, subscription gating.

A third exists for rate limiting: `{message, retry_after}` with **no `success` key**.

So: check `success === false` *and* read both `error` and `message`. Reading only one loses half
the failures.

## `?paginated=true` changes the response shape

`GET /api/contacts` and `GET /api/groups` return a flat array in `data` by default. With
`?paginated=true` they return `data: {items, pagination: {page, limit, total, totalPages}}`.

`limit` defaults to **20** and caps at 500. If you validate the page, `totalPages` is
`ceil(total / limit)` and `page` echoes what you asked for.

There is also a *second, unrelated* pagination shape: the message-log and session-log routes use
Laravel's length-aware paginator (`current_page`, `data`, `per_page`, `total`, …). Two shapes in
one API is not a design anyone chose; it is what the interface does.

## Contacts and groups carry both key spellings

A contact is keyed on `jid` in list responses and `id` in the single-contact response. wapi emits
both with the same value in both places, so read whichever you prefer — but do not assume a key
is absent because the other one is present.

Groups likewise carry `jid` and `id`, and both `name` and `subject` (same value). Participants
carry `{jid, isAdmin, isSuperAdmin}` and `{id, admin}` at once.

`imgUrl` and `status` on a contact are **always null in a list**. A profile picture and an
"about" string are per-contact fetches against WhatsApp; a list call does not make N of them.

## `GET /api/messages/{msgId}/info` uses WhatsApp's types, not the API's

Two fields do not match what a send returns:

- `messageTimestamp` is a **string** — it is a protobuf 64-bit integer, which JSON cannot hold
  as a number.
- `status` is a **number**: `0` error, `1` pending, `2` sent, `3` delivered, `4` read. A send
  returns the word `"in_progress"`; this returns the numeric acknowledgement.

## `msgId` is wapi's integer, not WhatsApp's id

Every send returns an integer `msgId` from a server-side sequence. Use it for `replyTo` and for
`/info`. WhatsApp's own string id is `data.key.id`, returned alongside.

## Identities are often LIDs, not phone numbers

WhatsApp increasingly addresses users by LID (`…@lid`) rather than phone number. A `remoteJid`
may be a LID with the phone number in `remoteJidAlt`. Resolve with `GET /api/lid-from-pn/{pn}`
and `GET /api/pn-from-lid/{lid}`; the latter returns `404` when no mapping is known, which is a
normal outcome and not an error to retry.

Never guess a phone number from a LID. They are not derivable from one another.

## Sends are not safely retryable

A timeout tells you the request failed, not that the message was not delivered. Retrying blindly
sends twice. Reconcile with `/info` using the `msgId` you already have, or accept the ambiguity —
do not paper over it with a retry loop.

## Reactions are a wapi extension

`POST /api/messages/react` takes `{key, emoji}` and is **not** part of the WasenderAPI
interface — they report reactions over webhooks but offer no way to send one. If you are
writing for both, feature-detect rather than assume.

Addressed by WhatsApp `key`, not `msgId`, for the same reason as `/messages/read`: you mostly
react to messages someone *else* sent, and those have no `msgId`. Take the key straight from the
webhook payload. An empty `emoji` removes an existing reaction.

## Rate limiting

`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and `X-RateLimit-Reset` are on every response. A
`429` carries `retry_after` in seconds. Sessions with `account_protection` enabled additionally
pace sends to one every five seconds, server-side.

## Connecting is asynchronous

`POST .../connect` returns immediately with a status, possibly `NEED_SCAN` plus a `qrCode`. Note
the status is SCREAMING_CASE in connect responses and lowercase everywhere else — another
inherited inconsistency. Poll `GET /api/status` until it reads `connected`; the QR rotates while
you wait.
