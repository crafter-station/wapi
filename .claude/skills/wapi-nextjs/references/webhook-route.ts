 * wapi webhook receiver.

 * Copy to `src/app/api/wapi/webhook/route.ts`.
 *
 * Two properties this handler exists to get right:
 *
 * 1. It reads the **raw body** and verifies before parsing. `req.json()` would consume the
 *    stream, leaving nothing to compute an HMAC over, and would parse attacker-controlled JSON
 *    before establishing that it came from wapi.
 * 2. It **acknowledges immediately** and does the work in `after()`. Delivery retries with
 *    backoff on any non-2xx, so a slow handler turns one event into several.
