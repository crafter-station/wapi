/**
 * The sandbox — a fake number on a fake WhatsApp.
 *
 * **A wapi extension**, not part of the WasenderAPI interface. It exists because linking a real
 * number is the highest-friction step in this product and the one that carries a ban risk, so
 * you should not have to do it to find out whether your integration works.
 *
 * A sandbox session goes through the same routes and the same code as a real one: it pairs
 * itself after a few seconds, has a small deterministic directory, accepts sends and can be made
 * to receive them. Its number lives under ITU country code 999, which is unassigned and cannot
 * route anywhere.
 *
 * Two differences from production, deliberate and worth knowing before you tune anything against
 * them: `account_protection` pacing is ignored, so sends return immediately where production
 * would wait five seconds; and `decrypt-media` returns a fixed PNG rather than real media.
